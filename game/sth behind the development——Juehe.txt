	Ever since the breakdown of Roma Arisen Project and a game jam gone horribly wrong, I held a high doubt of my capabilities of being a video game producer and creator. However, in this experience of making the reloaded version of Unique Gaming Girls, I have regained my confidence.	We began with a familiar engine and a familiar story, taking a conservative approach to ensure nothing can go wrong. Despite this, we still faced many challenges such as exams getting in our way and personal health issues affecting my production efficiency. But as one from Pixar said ¡°You admire a character more for trying than for their successes¡±, perhaps just like the girls in our game¡¯s attempts to grow out of their mental struggles and find true partnership, the process of Unique Gaming Girls ? reloaded edition¡¯s development is already meaningful. Indeed, this is the first time I have challenged myself to lead a long-term extracurricular game project while keeping up with my studies at USC Games. Throughout the very process, while my production, programming and UI design skills are still far from perfect, they have received valuable improvements.	Big cheer and thanks to KoliQed for backing me up in my hard times, teaching me how to write the screens Ren¡¯py file and remaking the BGMs from the original edition, to Amy and Akihi for their awesome and effective character artworks, to Rain for her unwavering perseverance in rewriting the script, to Yaxuan and Gabrielle (Luca) for their attractive cutscenes, to Wendy for her ready-and-able emergency reinforcement given in the most critical times of the development, to FallingStars, Ashlyn and Brian for their new BGMs as skillful as always, to Allen for his quality assurance based on the deep experiences of countless otaku works, to Jannie, Kevin and CJ for their bridging of the language barriers I faced as a non-native English speaker, to the original Unique Gaming Girls dev team for the precious art, UI, music and story assets, to all valuable support from RDFZ Game Design, Show¡¯s Chance and Dimensional Lab, to the hardworking staff at itch.io and the Yuri Game Jam, and to YOU, for dedicating your time playing our game.	Perhaps we¡¯ll meet again in another game by RDFZ Game Design, Show¡¯s Chance or Dimensional Lab. Whether it¡¯s in Mandarin or English, have fun playing! Please support us in the Yuri Game Jam, thanks!	                                      ¡ª¡ªproducer Juehe, leader of Dimensional Lab
