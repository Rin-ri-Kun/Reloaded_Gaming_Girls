哇轮到我了！想不到有一天我也可以写制作感言——
如果你看到这里，说明你大概率已经打通这个游戏啦~恭喜你！


        这是我第一次担任某个游戏的编写者。
之前有写过故事，但第一次以游戏的形式呈现。这真的是一个非常奇妙的体验。


因为是重制版，很感谢原版故事的创作者们！我在他们的基础上，尝试对文笔进行了优化，并添加了一些细腻的情感互动。希望这些内容能够让你会心一笑，感受到这四位姑娘的美好和善良。
也很感谢制作组的每一个人，流畅的动画，可爱的立绘和cg，精美的UI…是大家一起让这四位少女“活”了起来。


第一次见到这个游戏的时候，就有被他感动到。尤其是在看到魏江和区洋拥抱的场景...那一刻魏江就像一颗救世的小太阳一样！像每个故事里都有的闪闪发光的女孩子...在活泼开朗的同时，也在照亮他人。与之相对的，区洋则是在苦痛回忆中挣扎求生的女孩子。她顽强的生命力和对友谊的渴望同样令人动容。


两位人物的性格和经历就像站在了两个不同的方面，恰如一面镜子，映射出彼此，也救赎着彼此。这种联结仿佛在创作之初就存在着 - 她们本就是一体两面的。她们之间相互奔赴的情感才更加令人动容。


在写这个故事的时候，我始终觉得，不只是魏江“救赎”了区洋，而区洋也教会了魏江，世界上其实并不全是阳光和彩虹。恐怖的霸凌，控制欲极强的父母，糟糕透顶的朋友...其实无时无刻都在世界的角落上发生着。总有人正在经历区洋般的痛苦。


也许你会发现，自己更像魏江，渴望用温暖和力量去帮助身边的人；又或者，你更像区洋，努力在苦难中挣扎，寻找属于自己的光亮。
其实，无论你是哪一方，都希望你能从这个故事中获得勇气。正如魏江的陪伴让区洋迈出了第一步，区洋最终的改变也离不开她内心深处对未来的渴望。成长和救赎从来不是单向的，帮助他人也是帮助自己，而自我救赎的力量更是深藏在每个人的心底。
最后，感谢你游玩这个游戏，也感谢你喜欢这个游戏。
希望你能从这四位女孩子的成长中，感受到力量和温暖，勇敢面对生活中的挑战。


今后我也会继续创作的！
期待未来还能与你们分享更多的故事。

Hi there~ It’s my turn to write a production reflection!
If you are reading these sentences, it probably means you’ve completed the game—congratulations!
This was my first time working as a writer for a game. While I’ve written stories before, presenting one in a game format was a completely new and magical experience.
Since this is a reloaded edition, I want to express my appreciation to the original creators of this story! Building on their foundation, I refine the writing and add more emotional interactions. I hope these additions can bring you a smile. 
I am also very grateful to everyone on the production team. The smooth animations, cute character designs and CG, and adorable UI design...It was the efforts of everyone that brought “life” to these four unique gaming girls.
When I first played this game, I was deeply moved - especially when I saw the scene where Lindsey embraces Donna. In that moment, Lindsey is like sunshine, radiating warmth and hope. Like those bubbly girls in every story, she’s both extroverted and quietly bringing power to others. On the other hand, Donna was struggling to survive from her painful memories; her resilience and eagerness for a bright future are also touching.
Their personalities and experiences may seem to come from opposite ends of the spectrum, but they reflect each other’s struggles, like two halves of a mirror, ultimately lighting each other. This bond has existed from the very beginning - they are like two sides of a coin. This mutual journey toward healing makes their story so meaningful.
When I read and rewrote this story, I realized it wasn’t just about Lindsey “saving” Donna. Donna also taught Lindsey that the world isn’t always “sunshine and rainbows”. Bullying, controlling parents, and toxic relationships - these cruel realities are happening in this world every second. Many people are experiencing struggles just like Donna’s.
Maybe you think of yourself more like Lindsey, striving to bring warmth and empower others. Or maybe you relate more to Donna, fighting through pain and struggling to find your true path.
No matter which side you relate to, I hope this story inspires you with courage. Just as Lindsey’s support helped Donna take her first step to move forward, Donna’s transformation was also fueled by her deep desire for sincere friendship. Growth and healing are never one-sided - they are mutual journeys. Whether you’re helping others or finding your own way, you are pursuing a bright future.
Finally, thank you for playing this game. I hope you draw strength from these girls' unique journeys and face life's challenges with resilience and courage.
I’ll continue writing in the future.
And I’m looking forward to sharing new stories with you! ^v^
