	It was a really interesting experience to develop a game with Dimensional Lab (Seth)! Finally I can say that I had gained a great development on my programing and composing skill compared to the original version of "Unique Gaming Girls".
	All in all, 2 months was not enough for develop a game, especially when I have had 3 exams during this time......add more character to make the whole story more complex, add more ways to play(interact), change the frame of the whole story, and more thoughts were not prepared to show in this game, but I think what we have is already enough for you to play for a while.
	No matter in which version, the original version and the reloaded version, girls are all had (or at least have chance to have) a good ending that belongs to themselves, I hope that you can also find a faithful friend or a sprit partner in your life.
	Maybe next time we will meet again in another game (even though it won't be developed in English), have fun time on playing! Please vote for us if there is a vote in Yuri Game Jam, thanks!——KoliQed

Sorry for my terrible grammar :(
