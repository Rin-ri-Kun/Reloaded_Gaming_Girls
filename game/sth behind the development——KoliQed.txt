	It was a really interesting experience to develop a game with Dimensional Lab (Juehe)! Finally I can say that I had gained a great development on my programing and composing skill compared to the original version of "Unique Gaming Girls".
	All in all, 2 months was not enough to develop a full game, especially when I have 3 exams during this time...... Adjusting the characters to make the whole story more complex, adding more ways to play(interact), changing the frame of the whole story and more ideas were not prepared in time to show in this game, but I think what we have is already enough for you to play for a while.
	No matter in the original version or the reloaded version, the girls in the games all had (or at least have chance to have) a good ending that belongs to themselves, I hope that you can also find a faithful friend or a soulmate in your life.
	Maybe next time we will meet again in another game (even though it won't be developed in English), have fun playing! Please support us in the Yuri Game Jam, thanks!
